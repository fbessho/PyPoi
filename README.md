# PyPoi
**PyPoi** is an image processing GUI program written in Python. It stands for "**Py**thon Program for **Poi**sson Image Editing"

It enable you to try Poisson Image Editing method interactively.
Some examples are already ready for you, but you can also load arbitrary images and try it.

## Get Started
Well... no worries! If you're using **Windows** or **Mac OS**, you simply need to download files and run it to try this program.

### Simple installation

    $ pip install PyPoi

### Alternative installation
1. Go to [the release page](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/releases)
2. From the latest version, download zip file (recommended) or executable file.
3. If you download zip file, extract the file in any folder, and double click

### Run from repository (for developer)
You need to have **Python2.7** and pip installed before starting it.
It is recommended to use virtualenv. Please refer to [this guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/
) to know how to install/use it if you're not familiar with it.

First of all, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi.git
cd PyPoi
```
Then create a new virtualenv and install required packages.
```
mkvirtualenv pypoi
```
Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**If you get error in pyamg installation, please install numpy first by the following command, and try the install command above again.**
```
pip install $(grep numpy requirements.txt)
# or
# pip install numpy==1.8.1
# or
# pip install numpy
```
Alright, now you're ready to start. Try the following command.
An old-fashioned tkinter GUI should appear in front of you :beer:.
```
python gui.py
```


## What is Poisson Image Editing?
Poisson Image Editing is a technique to blend two images _seamlessly_.

This method is firstly introduced by Patrick PÃ©rez and others in ACM SIGGRAPH 2003.
The original theses is available
[here (pdf)](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall10/cos526/papers/perez03.pdf).

### Resources
There are many resources about Poisson Image Editing and I'll leave explanations to them.

## Found issues?
Please raise an issue from [github issue page](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues).

## What's next?
I know there are a lot of space to improve.
Main enhancements are listed in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues), for example,
* [#8  Gradient mixture support](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues/8)
* [#3  Add tests](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues/3)
* [#12 Calculation speed improvement](https://github.com/fbessho/PyPoi/issues/12)

It's more than welcome if you can pick up one/some of them.
